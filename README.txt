Playing around with Wikipedia speedrunning (https://wikispeedruns.com). The
project uses WebGraph (https://webgraph.di.unimi.it) and is based on Nix
(https://nixos.org). The wikipedia crawls were kindly provided by LAW
(https://law.di.unimi.it/webdata/enwiki-2021).

To experiment install the Nix shell and run `nix-shell`.
